# BBS-Ada
The root package for all of my Ada library projects.  It doesn't contain much of anything by itself.  It only
exists to provide the root namespace.  My other projects will be bbs.<something>.

There's nothing earthshaking in here so you're welcome to copy it as you see fit.  You may just want to change it
to your name and initials.
