# BBS-Ada
The root package for all of my Ada library projects.  It doesn't contain much of
anything by itself.  It only exists to provide the root namespace.  My other
projects will be bbs.<something>.

This repository also contains some basic packages that are used by multiple other
projects.  Currently, the following packages are included.

# BBS-units
This package contains definitions and conversions for various physical units.
The definitions are based off of Float which gives adequate precision for most
physical measurements.  If you are doing better than that, you probably know
what you are doing and can adjust things to suit.
